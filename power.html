	<h1>Power</h1>
	<P>My character can turn into any inanimate object he touches. He likes to turn into anyhting that has a good view of people. Michael picks and writes observations about a random person, he uses his notes/observations to write books about life. His storys range from funny to meaningful and sell out every time he publishes them.</P>
