	<h1>Environment</h1>
	<p>My character lives alone in a small, cozy house. He regularly sees and hears birds chirping early in the morning and wolfs howling late at night. Many animals such as deers and foxes visit his backyard filled with berry bushes. Michael enjoys taking pictures of the animals in order to incorperate them in his books.</p>
