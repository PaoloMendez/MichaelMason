	<h1>Physical Appearance</h1>
	<p>Michael is average height and isn't fat or skinny. He has a big, curly mustache and long, brow hair. His eye color is black and he has a small nose. My character sometimes wears glasses and also likes to wear anything that has some sort of green tint to it because it's his favorite color. </p>
